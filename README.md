### Current Features
Submit a batch of text records, and the functions return all key topics or sentiments. This is intended for exploration of data sources. It returns an aggregated set of all topics and scores detected.

### Not a bug
The number of topics returned may exceed the number of text records submitted. This is normal behavior.
